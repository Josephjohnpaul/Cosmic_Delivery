# Cosmic Delivery - Interplanetary E-commerce Platform

## Overview

Cosmic Delivery is a humorous e-commerce application that simulates selling Earth products to other planets at astronomically high prices. Originally built with React and Express, the application has been completely converted to a single standalone HTML file with vanilla JavaScript, eliminating all backend dependencies. The application showcases products with detailed cost breakdowns that include ridiculous intergalactic shipping fees, cosmic insurance, and planetary hazards. The system includes regular products, exclusive planet-specific items, client-side pricing generation, and interactive features like a shopping cart and price comparison tools.
